    <h2>The Collage</h2>
    <p>We had many great moments together and I wanted to capture them in a collage. This is a collection of pictures that I took of you and me. These were pictures that I wanted to keep and share with you. I really hope you like them. These photos contain memories we will cherish forever. These contain memories that are goofy and funny and some that were normal and just nice. I hope you like them as much as I do.</p>
